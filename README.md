# Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species

This project uses K-Means clustering to group Antarctic penguin species based on their physical characteristics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering visualization
- Statistical analysis of cluster characteristics

## Requirements
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
```bash
python penguins_cluster.py
```

## Dataset
The project uses penguin measurement data including culmen length, culmen depth, and other physical features.

## Results
The project generates:
- Elbow curve plot to determine optimal number of clusters
- Scatter plot showing penguin clusters based on culmen measurements
- Statistical summary of each cluster's characteristics
